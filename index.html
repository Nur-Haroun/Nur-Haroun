        <h1> Welcome to Nur's First Website </h1>
        <p> This is a simple webpage created as part of a learning exercise. </p>
        <p> I am a second year OI 244 student at Stellenbosch University. I also take many first year BA modules <em>(it's a long story)</em>. </p>
        <p> Recently, I have taken an interest in creating my own coffee syrups so that I can make my own cafe-grade lattes and save some money.</p>
        <p> Excitingly enough it is actually the week of my 21st birthday when I am doing this prac, so I hope for good things to come!</p>
